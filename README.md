# odin-recipes
My odin-recipe project is to build a basic recipe website.

This website is designed to contain a main index page which has links to a couple of recipes.

Developing this website will give me the chance to demonstrate the following skills:
* Web development (HTML, CSS and JavaScript)
* Web Project management - from start to finish
* Problem solving (most especially when encoutered technical issues)
* Programming (as I write more lines of codes)
* Communication and Collaboration - As I engage with peers during technical errors
* UI/UX Design - experience id designing webpages that a visually appealing and easy to navigate
